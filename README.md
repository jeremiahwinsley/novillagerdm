# No Villager Death Messages
No Villager Death Messages for Forge 1.16.5 - disables console spam from villager deaths

See also [MC-165985](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-165985).

By default, villagers log a message to the console every time one is killed.<br>
This results in way too many messages when players are running any sort of villager farm.

This mod adds a Log4j2 filter that blocks the death message.
